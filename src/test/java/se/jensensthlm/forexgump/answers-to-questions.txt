1- Yes it responds correctly since you're testing that you're getting the code and not that it's missing.

2- Answer: You should not unittest DTO's getters and setters, unless they contain some complex logic that requires
testing. Generally the tests are tested in their respective unittests and thus don't need to be tested in the DTO

3- The URL for selling is misleading as it's the amount in SEK not the currency in the URL. The rate is a weak part
since it's the same rate for buying and selling thus you can get rounded up and just keep exchanging at certain levels
to make money off the system. That you need to exchange Euro to SEK then SEK to USD instead of exchanging Euro to USD straight away.
